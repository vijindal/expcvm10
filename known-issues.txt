1. Maintaining composition list inside a phase: Many model may have internal parameters, then composition list will differ from combined list of parameters. 
If two separate composition lists are maintained, these lists should always be updated simultanously. One can have a single list, then location of the 
composition variable in the combined list should be maintained separately. One more posibility is to have a two-dimenational list containing only internal paramters
and compositions.  
2. Maintaining phase status 
3. issues related to the number of moles of phases, n, to be fixed: values to be taken from the phases or from conditions or from the method itself.
4, Read parameter list from the database: issues of handleing pure elements parameter, paramteres are functions of tempaerture only
